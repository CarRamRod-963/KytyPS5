# KytyPS5 Yōtei fork

An experimental fork of [KytyPS5](https://github.com/KytyPS5/KytyPS5) (itself based on
[Kyty](https://github.com/InoriRus/Kyty)) that targets **one game only: Ghost of Yōtei (PS5)**. Every change in this
tree is made, measured and tested against that game. Other titles are not tested and may run worse than on upstream
KytyPS5; use upstream for them. The upstream README ([KytyPS5](https://github.com/KytyPS5/KytyPS5#readme)) is kept
unchanged in the source tree as `README.md`.

Downloads and bug reports: [github.com/Erlou93/KytyPS5-Yotei](https://github.com/Erlou93/KytyPS5-Yotei)
([Releases](https://github.com/Erlou93/KytyPS5-Yotei/releases), [Issues](https://github.com/Erlou93/KytyPS5-Yotei/issues)).

This repository contains **no game files, no firmware, no system software and no material taken from the game's
code**. You need your own legally obtained dump of the game. Where the emulator relies on how the game behaves (for
example the layout of a table the game fills in memory), that knowledge is described in comments as behaviour; no game
code is copied.

## Status

- Work in progress. The game boots, loads saves and is playable, but runs well below the PS5's frame rate and some
  effects still differ from the PS5 (see [Known workarounds](#known-workarounds)).
- Correctness is checked against reference captures of the game's own GPU work: a fix counts as correct when the
  emulator computes the same results as the PS5 on the data the game really uses.
- Performance work is done behind switches that have a verify mode (old and new path compared, 0 differences) before
  they become the default.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11, 64-bit; a CPU with AVX2 (the release build uses `/arch:AVX2`).
- A Vulkan 1.3 GPU with current drivers. Development and all testing are done on an **NVIDIA GeForce RTX** card
  (RTX 5070 Ti, 16 GB). AMD and Intel GPUs are untested; a few exact half-precision paths are enabled only on devices
  that were measured (NVIDIA), other vendors take slower but exact fallbacks.
- 32 GB of RAM recommended (the game needs about 20 GB of free commit) and several GB of free disk space for the shader
  and pipeline caches.

## Playing (release package)

1. Unpack the zip into an empty folder (not under `Program Files`; the emulator writes its caches, saves and logs next
   to itself, the launcher its settings, `Kyty.ini`; nothing is written anywhere else).
2. Start `launcher.exe`, choose the folder of your Ghost of Yōtei dump (game version **1.512** is the one tested) and
   press **Play**.
3. **First start:** the package ships shader hints for the game (`hints\`, a list of the shaders the game uses, without
   any game code). On the first Play the launcher finds those shaders in your game files and compiles them before the
   game starts; this takes a few minutes and runs only once. The game then starts by itself. Without it the first
   hours stutter while shaders compile during play.
4. **Graphics mode:** the game's own *Performance* mode is the one tested. In *Quality* mode the game changes its
   internal resolution all the time, which makes the screen flicker in this build; turn on the **Render at 1080p** mod
   (launcher, Mods page) for Quality mode. The **Shorter detail distance (LOD 0.4)** mod gives the largest speed-up
   (about +16%, +29% while walking) at the cost of simpler distant objects.
5. **Performance panel:** F2 shows or hides it in game, Shift+F2 shows its details (frame time, CPU waiting on the GPU,
   draw calls, shader compiles, memory). The launcher's Overlay option shows it from the start.
6. **If the game crashes:** every run writes a log to `_Logs` next to the emulator (the newest 10 are kept). Launcher,
   Advanced page, **Export bug report** packs the newest logs, the settings and the system info into one zip, with your
   user and computer names replaced; attach it to an issue at
   [github.com/Erlou93/KytyPS5-Yotei/issues](https://github.com/Erlou93/KytyPS5-Yotei/issues).

The package has the same steps with pictures in `KytyPS5-Yotei-Player-Guide.pdf`.

What to expect: on the test PC (Ryzen 7 9800X3D, RTX 5070 Ti) the game runs at roughly 13-17 fps in towns and 21-25
fps in the open world with the default settings, more with the mods above. The emulator's GPU work runs on four threads, each on its own
physical CPU core, chosen automatically for the processor (`KYTY_GPU_THREAD_CPUS=off` turns that off).

Known slow spot: some in-engine cutscenes (for example the Snake cutscene) drop to about 6-7 fps for a minute, with
a few seconds at 1-2 fps; the game returns to its usual frame rate after them. The game renders them at up to 4K,
and in the first ~50 s after a save is loaded the emulator still translates the game's shaders in the background
(again on every start). The **Render at 1080p** mod helps a little (about +10% in that cutscene).

## Building (Windows)

Toolchain used for this fork:

- Git (with submodules);
- CMake 3.22.1 or newer and Ninja (the copies shipped with Visual Studio work);
- Visual Studio 2022 or Build Tools 2022 with the **Desktop development with C++** workload (Windows SDK, `vcvars64.bat`);
- LLVM **20.1.8** for Windows (`clang-cl`, `lld-link`, `llvm-mt`); the MSVC compiler `cl.exe` is not supported;
- [glslang](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glslang/releases) (`glslangValidator` or `glslang` on `PATH`, or
  `-DKYTY_GLSLANG_VALIDATOR=<path>`);
- FFmpeg is downloaded by CMake on the first configure (or point `-DFFMPEG_PREBUILT_DIR=<dir>` at an unpacked package);
- for the launcher only: Qt 6 for MSVC, 64-bit, with Concurrent, Network and Widgets (6.7.2 is used for this fork).

The fork has its own Qt launcher (`src/launcher`): game selection, display and graphics settings, shader
precompilation with a progress bar, the shader cache, log folder and a local bug-report export. Its design is
described in [docs/launcher/DESIGN-SPEC.md](docs/launcher/DESIGN-SPEC.md); how to build it (with or without the
emulator) is in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). The emulator also runs on its own from the command line. To build
the emulator only, without Qt, from an **x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022** (or after calling
`vcvars64.bat`), in the repository root, with `LLVM` set to your LLVM 20.1.8 folder:

```bat
git submodule update --init --recursive

cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DKYTY_BUILD_LAUNCHER=OFF ^
  "-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=%LLVM%/bin/clang-cl.exe" "-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=%LLVM%/bin/clang-cl.exe" ^
  "-DCMAKE_LINKER=%LLVM%/bin/lld-link.exe" "-DCMAKE_MT=%LLVM%/bin/llvm-mt.exe" ^
  "-DCMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASE=/O2 /Ob2 /DNDEBUG /arch:AVX2 -flto=thin" ^
  "-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE=/O2 /Ob2 /DNDEBUG /arch:AVX2 -flto=thin"

cmake --build build --target kyty_emulator -j 4
```

The reference interpreter used for correctness checks (`tools/refinterp`, CPU only) builds with
`tools\refinterp\build.bat`; set `VCVARS64` (path to `vcvars64.bat`) and `CLANG_CL` (path to `clang-cl.exe`) unless
both are already on hand in your prompt.

## Running

Start `launcher.exe` (next to `kyty_emulator.exe`), choose the game folder and press **Play**, or start the emulator
directly:

```bat
kyty_emulator.exe --game "D:\Games\<your Ghost of Yotei dump>" --screen-width 1280 --screen-height 720
```

Run `kyty_emulator.exe --help` for the logging, validation and debugging options; `--perf-overlay` shows the
performance panel from the start (F2 / Shift+F2 in game). Tessellation is on by default
(`--no-tessellation` turns it off). The first start compiles shaders and pipelines in the background, so the first
minutes stutter; later starts reuse the caches. `--precompile-only` (the launcher's "Precompile shaders") compiles the
shaders recorded in earlier runs and exits without starting the game. `--export-hints <file>` with `--precompile-only`
writes the recorded shaders as a hints file (no game code), `--import-hints <file>` finds a hints file's shaders in the
game folder and adds them before compiling.

## Settings are defaults in code

No launch script or settings file is needed: a plain `kyty_emulator.exe --game ...` uses the same settings as the
maintainer's test runs. All settings this fork depends on are defaults in the source:

- `src/common/envDefaults.h` holds the table of settings that used to come from the launch script, each marked as
  `config` (ordinary setting or measured performance switch), `unproven` (probably hardware behaviour, named
  `FIX_`) or `workaround` (named `WORKAROUND_`, see below), with the work item that will replace it;
- every other switch has its default where it is read (`std::getenv("KYTY_...")`), documented in the comment above it.

An environment variable still overrides any default (`KYTY_X=0` turns a switch off), and `KYTY_ENV_DEFAULTS=0` ignores
the whole table. At start the emulator prints one `ENV_DEFAULT KYTY_X=value source=env|code` line per table entry.
`KYTY_TRACE_*` and `KYTY_CAPTURE_*` switches are diagnostics, off by default.

Which settings keep the shader cache warm: only the settings listed in `Common::ShaderEnv::Names`
(`src/common/shaderEnv.h`) change the translated shaders or pipelines, and only their effective values (the
environment, else the code default) decide whether the pipelines of earlier runs count as compiled. Changing any other
`KYTY_` variable - reports (`KYTY_TRACE_*`), live A/B, pad scripts, dispatch skip lists such as the "No
particles" mod (`KYTY_DIAG_SKIP_CS_HASHES`), precompiler threads, VRAM budget - keeps the cache; changing a listed one
makes the next start compile in the background again. The start log has one `ENV_FINGERPRINT hash=...` line: two runs
with the same hash share the cache.

## Known workarounds

The goal of the fork is a build with **no workarounds**: every approximation is replaced by a proper implementation
(checked with a verify mode, 0 differences) and then removed. Until then the following are on by default. They are
the `workaround` entries of `src/common/envDefaults.h` plus a few defaults in code ("(code)"); names are given without
the `KYTY_` prefix. The environment can turn them off (`=0`), but the game then fails or shows errors: they stay on
until their replacement lands.

| Area (work item) | Switches | What may differ from the PS5 |
|---|---|---|
| GPU-written memory (D6) | `DIAG_BDA_STORE_TRACK`, `DIAG_BDA_STORE_UNTRACKED`, `DIAG_BDA_PIN_FAULTED`, `DIAG_FAULT_WINDOW_KB`, `DIAG_SCALAR_READS_IGNORE_ADDRESS_WRITES` | pages the GPU writes through pointers are tracked late and kept generously; rare stale reads |
| Image memory shared by several images (D4/D5) | `WORKAROUND_ALIAS_SYNC` | transient targets copied between aliases; some post-processing (screen-space GI filter) may be off; in the game's Quality mode, where the internal resolution changes all the time, the screen can flicker and textures can vanish for a moment (use the "Render at 1080p" mod). The exact replacement exists (`KYTY_FIX_IMAGE_MEMORY_OWNER=1`: no flicker) but costs 10-15% fps, so it is not the default yet |
| Stencil and depth metadata (D8) | `WORKAROUND_STENCIL_PLANE_SYNC`, `WORKAROUND_STENCIL_STORAGE_SHADOW`, `WORKAROUND_PRESERVE_STENCIL`, `WORKAROUND_STENCIL_ALIAS_COPY`, `WORKAROUND_HTILE_FULL_RANGE`, `FIX_HTILE_RMW_CLEAR` (code), `WORKAROUND_DEPTH_ENCODING_LENIENT` | stencil kept as copies, HTILE emulated as "full range"; occasional missing masks or shadow tiles |
| Colour compression (A5) | `WORKAROUND_DCC_FAST_CLEAR`, `DIAG_DCC_KEEP_BUFFER_WRITES`, `DIAG_COLOR_META_UNALIGNED_SKIP` | simplified DCC clear handling |
| One fill compute shader (A5) | `WORKAROUND_FILL_CS_HASHES` (code: shader `2bd3cd129405f9a9`) | the shader is recognised by its hash and its stores are taken as a DCC fast clear (it still runs); with the list set by hand, a listed shader's output is filled instead of computed |
| GPU-selected (bindless) textures (D1/D2) | `DIAG_BINDLESS_EAGER`, `DIAG_NULL_TEXTURE_GRAY`, `DIAG_BINDLESS_IMMEDIATE_BUDGET` (code: 64 new textures per frame) | a new texture can show a placeholder for 1-3 frames; unresolved descriptors read as empty (e.g. snow and mud tracks). Fixed since 2026-10-29 (C9): texture tables over 1 MiB (particles, mist) are translated like every other table instead of showing placeholders past 1 MiB, and a table the table path cannot take stops with `BINDLESS_TABLE_REFUSED` instead of a silent placeholder |
| Shaders capped (D7) | `SHADER_LOOP_LIMIT_HASHES` (2 shaders), `DIAG_SKIP_UNSUPPORTED_CS`, global loop watchdog `KYTY_SHADER_LOOP_LIMIT` (code; a safety net, not a workaround: every shader loop ends after 65,536 iterations so a runaway loop cannot hang the GPU - it never fired in our tests, 0 of ~1,950 checks at the gate and in the village, 29.10). The particle-emit shader 142383a7 is no longer skipped (29.10; it runs rarely - if a crash follows the log line `W9_PARTICLE_EMIT`, report it) | rare shaders with a loop cap |
| Terrain shaders (M42) | `WORKAROUND_WATERFALL_POINTER_RECORD0` | approximate material table in some terrain shaders |
| Texture edge cases | `SDK_FIX_MIP_CHAIN_CLAMP`, `SDK_FIX_NULL_COMPARE_DEPTH`, `SDK_FIX_INTEGER_POINT` (code) | rare sampling edge cases approximated (logged) |
| Game-specific table (D6) | `RECORD_KEYED_GAME_COUNTS` (code) | one shader's record count is read from the game's data layout instead of a generic bound |

The hardware behaviour that was once a switch (formatted stores through GPU-selected descriptors, the GDS base in M0,
textures less aligned than their swizzle block, mip-tail slices) is always on now. Two table entries are marked
`unproven` (`FIX_TEXTURE_CLAMP_LAST_LEVEL`, `FIX_RT_11_11_10_FLOAT`: believed to be the hardware's behaviour, an
exactness check is still open). The game's GPU timer reads host GPU busy time (`FIX_VIRTUAL_GPU_CLOCK`); because the emulated frame takes
longer than on a PS5, the game stays at a lower internal resolution than on the console (1080p at the test scene of
most measurements). Reporting the time a PS5 would take is open.
