// the particle and mist tables (1.3 MB) take the table path like every other table - read and translated before the
// draw - up to the translation space (a heap showed a pending placeholder until GPU feedback and every key past 1 MiB
// as one).
// Table refresh by events and the change journal (bindless E1 fast version and v3, the only path; their
// checks 0 misses on 24.10): a slot whose
// last refresh replayed is not refreshed again while nothing its replay check reads has changed. Each slot knows the
// tables that hold it (owners); the changes the check reads - its image's change serial and the image-page epochs of
// its image's and its description's ranges - are journaled (drawRepeat.h) and mapped to the slots by image and by page
// (a page index of the slots' ranges), which are marked named until a replay check or a refresh of theirs runs. A slot
// dropped counts against its owners (no TableSlotsAlive walk), and a table lists its images again only when one of its
// own slots changed.
// The list path of tables over 1 MiB (bindless C9 variant A p. 1-3, notesANALIZA-FABLE-C9-2026-10-29.md §4; the only
// path; its check found refresh/release/touch misses 0 at the gate and in the
// open world): a large table's refresh visits only the slots on its list - those the journal named (NameSlot), those a
// refresh left without a replay (NoteFastSlot) - and its gpu_slots, instead of all 39,211 (~1.55 ms per frame). The
// slots it leaves alone would only pass the trusted skip; their LRU touch is virtual (FastTouchKeeps) and the use of
// every slot comes from its owners' last full refresh (Table::used_frame, ReleaseUnusedTableSlots). After a translation
// the table refreshes every slot once and builds its list.

	// Ghost of Yotei: 836 heaps, heap_fail=490, the terrain's distant-texture grid failing for every terrain draw). The
	// guest itself never shows a missing texture: its tables always hold valid descriptors, written before the submit.
	// A table is translated as a whole when a draw that reads it is prepared: every descriptor
	// field of every record (fields from the shader, records from the V# or the record count), each through the
	// texture cache like a bound texture, into a region of its own in an arena at the top of the translation buffer.
	// Entries are laid out by byte offset from the table's first byte (entry = offset / 4), so the heap of a record
	// table (which starts at its field) and the heap of a whole-V# table share one region: region + field / 4.
	// Slots belong to descriptor contents (TableSlotKey), so a table that moved in a ring reuses them; a table is
	// translated again only when its bytes changed (XXH3 of the bytes, checked once per command-buffer tick: the guest
	// cannot rewrite a table between two draws of one slice), one of its slots died, or a draw reads more of it.
