// KYTY_SHADER_PRECOMPILE=1: every compute permutation the GPU thread compiles is recorded once in
// _PipelineCache/<title>.cs.journal with every input of its translation and compile (shader code, user data, stage
// inputs, push-data start, resource specialization). Once the renderer is complete, the recorded permutations are
// translated and compiled again on background threads (KYTY_SHADER_PRECOMPILE_THREADS, default 4, below normal
// priority) and their compute pipelines created through the Vulkan pipeline cache, then destroyed: the driver has
// the pipeline before the game asks. Emulator changes alter the SPIR-V of every shader, and NVIDIA takes up to ~45 s
// per large wave64 compute pipeline; without this every one of them compiles again on the GPU thread in play.
// Nothing the GPU thread renders changes: it still translates, compiles and creates its own pipeline (which then
// hits the driver cache). A job running for the permutation the GPU thread is about to compile is waited for (its
// worker raised to normal priority); a queued one is dropped and compiled by the GPU thread as before.
// A record that was compiling when a run ended without a clean quit is a suspect: skipped for the rest of that
// emulator build (.suspects), so a record that crashes the recompiler cannot stop every start.
// Graphics pipelines likewise (KYTY_SHADER_PRECOMPILE_GRAPHICS=0 leaves them out): every stage permutation a draw
// compiles (vertex, mesh, LS/HS/DS, pixel) is recorded in <title>.gfx.journal, and every graphics pipeline the GPU
// thread creates from recorded stages as their record keys plus its key's state (attachment formats, vertex input,
// static parameters). A worker compiles each stage once (the jobs using it share the module) and creates the
// pipeline with the GPU thread's CreatePipelineInternal. The journal's header names the GPU: the records of another
// GPU are dropped. A pipeline this device cannot make (a missing feature, a value the pipeline code exits on) is
// skipped. A stage being compiled is in flight too: one that crashes is a suspect, and so is every pipeline using it.
