// KYTY_DIAG_TWIN_DISPATCH=<hex shader hash>[:<n>[:<hex variant bits>]] (diagnostic, default off; measurement only;
// notes\PERF-OGON-KARTY-2026-10-22.md 7.4): an exact check, on the GPU, of a change of a compute shader's whole module.
// At most one dispatch (direct or indirect) of the shader per n presented frames (default 8) runs twice: first "B", the
// same dispatch with its program looked up with the variant bits toggled in ShaderComputeInputInfo::compute_variant
// (default 2 = ComputeVariantPairOff: the two-lanes module against the paired one; 4 =
// ComputeVariantPairSpin: spin exchanges against the barrier ones), then "A", today's program,
// whose results stay. Before B every storage image the dispatch binds (each candidate of a GPU-selected table is a binding
// of its own; all storage bindings are taken, read-only ones compare equal), its written storage buffers and the GDS it
// binds are copied aside (device memory); after B its results are copied out and the originals copied back, so A runs on
// what it would have run on; A's results are copied out too. Once the GPU finished, B's and A's copies are compared word
// by word: one "PERF twin_dispatch" line per twin (running totals twins / words / differ, the first difference ever, and
// this twin's own counts). Accepted only with differ=0; a run with the same module on both sides (the shader left out of
// the pair list) tells whether the shader itself is deterministic. B runs with A's bound descriptors and push data, so
// both programs must lay them out alike, or the twin is skipped ("PERF twin_dispatch ... skipped: <reason>"), as are
// programs that write through addresses or record-keyed ranges, images not in the general layout, depth, compressed or
// multisampled storage images, table-mode dispatches and more than 1 GiB to copy. Every copy is ordered by barriers and
// the commands after the dispatch wait for the last one; the GPU thread only records (no wait). Nothing runs while unset.
