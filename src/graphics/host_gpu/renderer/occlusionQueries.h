// KYTY_FIX_OCCLUSION_QUERIES=1 (default off; read once, logged once as FIX_OCCLUSION_QUERIES): the guest's
// occlusion counters (EVENT_WRITE PIXEL_PIPE_STAT_DUMP) are backed by host Vulkan occlusion queries and written into
// guest memory by the GPU, at the point of the command stream where the guest dumped them. Without it every dump
// publishes a synthetic count that always reads "visible" (Ghost of Yotei: the sun/moon flares of
// Frame>Postprocessing>Bloom shine through walls and mountains, because the CS that turns 4 visible/total query
// pairs into flare visibility reads 16/16 = 1.0 every frame).

// The guest's occlusion queries. Everything runs on the GPU thread, in command order.
//
// Guest layout (PS5, GFX10 DBs): a dump at A writes the 64-bit sample counter of each of the 16 DBs to
// A + db * 16 and sets bit 63 once the value is there; a query is a begin dump at A and an end dump at A + 8, and
// its result is the sum over the DBs of (end - begin). The PS5 counts the samples that pass the depth/stencil
// tests of every draw between the two dumps, also of draws that write no color, depth or stencil (a "total" pass
// with the depth test off draws nothing at all but still counts).
//
// Host side: while a guest query is open, every render pass instance in which a guest draw is recorded is counted
// by one host query (begun lazily right before the first guest draw of the instance, ended before the instance
// ends or at the next dump), so the emulator's own blits and copies are never counted. Host queries are numbered
// in one sequence, so the samples of any guest query (also nested or interleaved ones) are exactly the host
// queries numbered between its begin and its end dump. A begin dump writes {0, ready} to the 16 begin slots; an end
// dump writes {0, ready} to the 16 end slots and then copies the host results (32-bit, the low dword of each slot)
// into the end slots of DB 1..15 with vkCmdCopyQueryPoolResults; DB 0 holds the samples of host queries that had to
// be summed on the CPU when a guest query spanned more than 15 of them (rare: a submit and wait). The guest's sum
// over the DBs is then the exact sample count, written on the GPU timeline before any later command reads it.
