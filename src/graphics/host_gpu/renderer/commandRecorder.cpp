// The render scheduler's Vulkan commands are copied into a ring and recorded
// by a worker thread. See commandRecorder.h for the overview; this file holds the details.
//
// Which calls go where (the dispatcher members are replaced once, in Install, and never again):
// - Serialized (KYTY_RECORD_CUSTOM_HOOKS and KYTY_RECORD_POD_HOOKS): every command the renderer
//   records, into the routed command buffer, is copied into the ring and later made by the worker with
//   the real function pointer. Arguments are copied by value; arrays and structs they point to are
//   copied into the packet; a pNext chain, a descriptor type or a size nothing here knows is not
//   copied: that one call drains the ring and goes straight to the driver ("unsupported").
// - Into any other command buffer (the presentation scheduler's, the readback and upload helpers'),
//   every hook calls the driver directly: one relaxed load and a compare.
// - All other vkCmd* functions (KYTY_RECORD_FALLBACK_HOOKS, one per remaining dispatcher member) into
//   the routed buffer: drain the ring, then call the driver directly.
// - vkBeginCommandBuffer/vkResetCommandBuffer on the routed buffer drain first. vkEndCommandBuffer on it
//   drains, ends the buffer (the caller sees the real result) and stops routing it.
// - Pool and destroy calls (KYTY_RECORD_POOL_HOOKS, KYTY_RECORD_DESTROY_HOOKS, and the VMA destroy
//   sites through DrainBeforeDestroy) drain what is published: an appended command may still name the
//   object. Vulkan only allows that after the commands finished, but nothing here relies on it.
//
// The worker never submits, presents, waits for a fence or takes a lock of the emulator: it only calls
// vkCmd* functions with arguments out of the ring. A thread waits for it only before ending a routed
// buffer, before direct commands, before destroying and when the ring is full, and the worker never
// waits for such a thread, so the waits end whenever the driver returns from the recorded calls.
// A wait that lasts more than a few seconds prints a RECORD_THREAD warning with the ring positions.
