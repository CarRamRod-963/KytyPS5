// (dynamic resolution: one allocation of the largest size, smaller views of it) and with other formats (transient
// memory reused by later passes of the frame). Each description is its own host image here, so the bytes one of them
// writes are what the others must show over the same addresses, in their own layouts. When an image is bound for
// sampling, storage or rendering and images overlapping its memory were written after it (content serial above
// max(content_serial, alias_synced_serial)), their bytes are brought in, oldest first:
// - every newer image has the image's layout (one level and layer each, level 0 at the same address, same tile mode,
//   bytes per element, pitch, type and colour transform): an image copy of the common rectangle - texel (x, y) is at the
//   same guest address in both;
// - otherwise through guest memory: a scratch buffer takes the image's own bytes (its download when the GPU wrote it and
//   nothing newer reached its memory through buffers, else the cached buffer of guest memory), then each newer image's
//   download in its own layout, and the image is loaded from it (the tiler's conversions both ways).
// Not covered (counted, kept as before): depth and stencil images, multisampled and block-compressed images, video-out
// compression. =2 (sampled, the first 4 syncs of an (image, newest writer) pair then 1 in 64): the guest bytes merged
// as above are kept, the image is downloaded over a copy of them after the sync, and the two are compared once the GPU
// finished (diff must be 0: the image holds exactly the merged guest bytes).
// =3 (probe, measurement only - the picture is wrong where the game reads such bytes): instead of bringing the newer
// bytes in, the image is filled with a pattern (bytes 0xA5; 0xFF, a NaN, in float formats, so blending carries it on),
// and its next binds download it and count the texels still holding the pattern: a sampled or storage bind finding it
// means the game reads bytes another image wrote before writing them itself. =4: the same counts without the fill
// (the baseline of patterns and NaNs the game's own data holds).
