// KYTY_TRACE_SYNC_TIMELINE=1 (diagnostic, default off; one static load per hook when off): every wait for the host
// GPU is attributed. Waits: MasterSemaphore::Wait calls that block, readback-queue and OOB fences, the GPU thread
// waiting for priority completions, WAIT_FLIP_DONE, game threads at a SuspendPoint. For each wait it records:
//   - the thread (gpu / prio / other);
//   - the site (copy / bar / eager / finish / unmap / ...);
//   - for BufferCache::ReadMemory, the reader (fault_game, invalidate, srt_walker, dcc_meta, ...) and the guest
//     address;
//   - the GPU work pending when the wait began (submissions not finished, age of the oldest one);
//   - whether the newest write of the needed bytes had already finished when the wait began (need_done: the wait
//     was for other work; granule: only the 64 KiB write-tick granule was unfinished) or the wait went beyond it
//     (beyond: it also waited for later submissions).
// Whether the GPU really changed the bytes the waiter needed is found by comparing each synchronous download with
// guest memory before the publish:
//   real   = the needed bytes changed;
//   page   = only other bytes of their 4 KiB pages changed (false sharing in a page);
//   window = only other downloaded pages changed (the read window);
//   same   = nothing downloaded differs (the bytes were only bound for writing, or rewritten unchanged);
//   nodl   = no download was compared (eager copy, priority completions, no GPU bytes).
// A fault reports only the faulting byte, so for faults the needed bytes are its 64-byte line. Changed bytes are
// counted in 8-byte words.
// Every ~5 s one "PERF sync_timeline" line. For 3 frames, detail lines: SYNC_TL (one per reader request or wait),
// SYNC_TL_GUEST (label writes, WAIT_REG_MEM blocks) and SYNC_TL_FRAME (per-frame totals). The detail frames are
// n+1..n+3 with KYTY_TRACE_SYNC_TIMELINE_FRAME=<n>, else the first 3 frames of KYTY_TRACE_FRAME_RANGE.
// KYTY_TRACE_SYNC_TIMELINE_FRAMES=<k> changes the 3.
